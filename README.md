# TODO
- element-naming according to flyer (numbered roofs)?
- move prices from list to popup?
- move list of valid mids and regex out of source-code
- Anonym element: don't write name to database
- implement module reservation (check on regular intervals wether reservation expired)
- implement proper donation link
- move to login-screen after password reset

# reservations
- e-mail bounce: delete reservation
