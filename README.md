- move prices from list to popup?
- move list of valid mids and regex out of source-code
- Anonym element: don't write name to database
- implement module reservation (check on regular intervals wether reservation expired / check everytime the caching function pulls from the database)
- implement proper donation link
- move to login-screen after password reset
- create mail-template-file

# reservations

## admin-panel
- list of reserved modules: confirm or deny -> create and send pdf on confirm
- change name of reservation / rework elements-view (keep as is but implement actions for reserved modules)
